Blueprint creates only the skeleton of each view associated with controllers defined in config (.yaml) file.

If you want to generate code for views you have to :

- use a Community Addons : [Tall-Forms](https://github.com/tanthammar/tall-blueprint-addon)

- create your own addon by :

Create your [service provider](https://github.com/sr57/laravel-blueprint-faq/blob/master/Create%20views/1-Service%20Provider)

Create your [stubs](https://github.com/sr57/laravel-blueprint-faq/blob/master/Create%20views/2-Stub=)
